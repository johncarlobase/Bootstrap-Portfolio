                    <p>Almost 42 yr old father of an adorable 5 yr little girl. Born in the Philippines then moved
                        to United states at 29 yrs old. I moved around a lot in the states from New York,
                        Nebraska, Indiana, Chicago, then the last 4 years here in Austin (and this would be home). I
                        have been
                        an Occupational Therapist for close to 20 years.
                        But if I wasn't doing that and if my parents where filthy rich I would have been be a musician.
                        Doing what I love.
                        I can play the guitar, piano, bass
                        guitar, Ukulele, drums. I collect guitars and the last time I counted, I have 15 guitars (mostly
                        acoustic) I appreciate all genres but the least would be death metal (you know, that
                        screaming-gurgling
                        singing) </p>

                    <p>I also love to ride my bicycle (road, MTB) and am usually at Veloway at Circle C doing a 30 mile
                        saturday morning ride.
                        I play badminton (the fierce asian kind. yeah google that!), Bowling, Volleyball, Basketball,
                        Swimming.</p>
